    "You now know how to forward model a simulation using Synthesizer and perform SED fits with Bagpipes. You have likely found that the infered physical properties can be quite unreliable which is an issue shared by many SED fitting codes. This has lead to heavy scrutiny of some of JWST's most interesting results regarding the overabundance and large masses of high-redshift galaxies.\n",
