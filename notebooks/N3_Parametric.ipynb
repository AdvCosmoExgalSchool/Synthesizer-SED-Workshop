    "In the first notebook you learnt how to use Bagpipes and found you had to adjust the fit instructions to get an accurate result. You then learnt how to use Synthesizer to create synthetic photometry which can be used to infer the properties of simulated galaxies in the same way. You likely found that the values recovered were not always accurate. This suggests that Bagpipes can be quite unreliable, but this is an issue suspected to be shared by many SED fitting codes. For this reason, some of JWST's most interesting results regarding the overabundance and large masses of high-redshift galaxies have been heavily scrutinised.\n",
